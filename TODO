- add ptlogwipe which will wipe all logs without
  requiring ptlogd to restart

ptlogexport
ptproxy

ptmark (mark a time between t0 and t1); also with a certain prio (low, high,
  crit etc) and maybe a textual description

- client needs to handle SIGPIPE if ptlogd dies

- make sure we don't grow to too many files in the directory so maybe invent
  something to come up with something that uses subdirs for the names

- parse python file and bail out if there's an error inthe script

- if directory is empty and empty idx file is created it doesnt
  look limke the new files will be setup properly and it will not
  log properly to the logfiles
